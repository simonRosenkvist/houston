The gun debate is a loaded (pun intended) topic in America, but when you feel this need to protect your children from shootings something somewhere is messed up! After looking at the guns in the store we went to Jessie\xb4s house where we did some shooting practice with unloaded guns and safety training. How to make sure that the gun is empty, how they are assembled and the four commandments of the "gun god", 1. Dont aim at people. 2. Finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot. 3. Assume the gun is loaded. Number four I cant remember, so probbably it wasnt that important.

Pork chops, chicken, bacon wrapped jalapeno cheeze and all manners of tasty things were cooked for us and everyone wanted the swedes to try the propper thanksgiving food - and tasty it was!

There were a lot of things to look at but the size of the rockets were amazing. Even seeing them on picture it is hard to convey the gravitas of being there in person. We also got told about the apollo missions, the robots and technology being used today and a whole lot of other space related facts. We met up with Jessie, (Nathans friend), later before we planned to go to Olive Garden, whom said that NASA and Olive Garden sends the same amount of people to space every year, - referring to the fact that NASA now buy seats on Russian space crafts instead of sending their own."}),o.a.createElement(g,{header:"Victorian Streets of Texas",stc:"vicotrianStreets",arr:w,alt:"victorian streets and storefronts",thesis:"The last day before I got the flu, (the same day as we visited NASA) we also went to a town with these really pretty vicotian streets and buildings. Next weekend Nathan and Madison were going to celebrate something similar to the renaissance fair but in this place and in a victorian setting.",description:"The stores around this town were mostly small so called brick and mortar shop and usually not parts of large chains. Also the restaurants had this really cool authentic atmosphere. We had a couple of tacos for lunch here and a beer. I hade a wheet beer and Rebecca had an IPA and Nathan had two cocktails. We also visited the harbour, the thing this town became famous for before the harbour in Houston was founded, and on our way out we went past the rich people district where fromer bankers and mobsters built massive houses for themselves.
